I am a button with several forms. Clicking on me toggles which form is shown and sends my target a message. If my isMomentary flag is true, then I return to my off state after I am pressed (i.e. when the mouse goes up).

I can also show a different form on mouse-over.

Finally, if I am disabled I can show a disabled form.
