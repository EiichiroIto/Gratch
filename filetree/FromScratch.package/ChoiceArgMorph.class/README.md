I am used to represent an ArgMorph that allows the user to choose from a popup menu of choices. For example, I might allow selection of a sensor port from the list ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd').

In an earlier version of Scratch, I was used to represent boolean values. That usage has been replaced with BooleanArgMorph.
