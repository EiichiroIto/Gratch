I am a simple, editable one-line string for use in dialog boxes.

If cr, lf, or enter is pressed and my client responds to it, I send the "accept" message to the client.

I support selection by dragging the mouse. Double-clicking on a word selects that word. Double-clicking at either end selects everything.

I respond to a number of editing keys including:

  backspace/delete				delete the current selection; backspace if nothing is selected
  ctrl-a							select all
  ctrl-z, ctrl-x, ctrl-c, ctrl-v		undo, cut, copy, paste
  left/right arrow				move the cursor left or right

Either the control or command key can be used to type the editing keys. That is, cmd-a does the same thing as ctrl-a. This should make both PC and Mac users happy.
